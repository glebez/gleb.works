## Personal page of Gleb Kostyunin

This is a repo for my personal page that is located at [gleb.works](https://gleb.works).

For a very long time working in web dev I didn't have a personal page, cause I didn't want just another Bootstrapy-feeling CV page on one hand and didn't have another idea worth enough to spend my time on it.

Luckily, the situation changed during my winter break, when I was nostalging over the games of my childhood, like Full Throttle, Monkey Island or Grim Fandango. I was inspired by dialogue mechanics in those games and went for that retro feel with a sprinkle of cyberpunk.

The project is powered by Next.js.
